# DSA-Lung_cancer_Prediction

This project involves working with a comprehensive dataset containing clinical, demographic, lifestyle, and laboratory features of lung cancer patients. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models that can help in:

   1. Predicting patient survival time (regression on Survival_Months).

   2. Identifying key factors that affect survival (feature importance analysis).

   3. Classifying patients into risk groups (clustering or classification models).

   4. Visualizing health trends among different patient groups (based on gender, smoking history, stage, etc.).

The dataset includes variables such as age, gender, tumor characteristics, comorbidities, blood pressure, blood test results, and smoking history. Machine learning models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost may be used for prediction tasks. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn will be used to discover patterns and relationships in the data.
